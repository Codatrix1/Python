"""
We use "truthy" and "falsy" to differentiate from the bool values True and False. A "truthy" value will satisfy the check performed by if or while statements. As explained in the documentation, all values are considered "truthy" except for the following, which are "falsy":

None
False
Numbers that are numerically equal to zero, including:
0
0.0
0j
decimal.Decimal(0)
fraction.Fraction(0, 1)
Empty sequences and collections, including:
[] - an empty list
{} - an empty dict
() - an empty tuple
set() - an empty set
'' - an empty str
b'' - an empty bytes
bytearray(b'') - an empty bytearray
memoryview(b'') - an empty memoryview
an empty range, like range(0)
objects for which
obj.__bool__() returns False
obj.__len__() returns 0, given that obj.__bool__ is undefined
